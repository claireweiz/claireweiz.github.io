  <h2>Day 50:</h2>
  <p>Day 50 is a data storing project, to add ideas and extract idea randomly. It's not difficult to construct but I do
    like this simple application. Hope in the future I can extend it to an real app that I can use on my phone!</p>

  <h2>Day 47:</h2>
  <p>Day 47 is to create a Top Trump game and let the player play against random enemy. Each character has pre-set data,
    but the characters are chosen by player and enemy generated randomly (I created a for-loop to exclude player's
    choice)</p>

  <h2>Day 42:</h2>
  <p>Day 42 ðŸ‘¾ MokÃ©Beast - monster character generator, allow user to input the monster's name, type (type is pre-set
    with different colour output) and other data.</p>

  <h2>Day 56:</h2>
  <p>Day 56 is to write code automatically sort data in csv file into file folders and txt files accordingly. If there's
    no file folders of singers exist, create the folder first, then create txt file under the folder naming the song
    title, and store the song details into the txt file.</p>
