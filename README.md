<h2>Description</h2>
My personal website, including landing page, about me, and portfolio. Simple as it is, which displays what I do and who I am.

<h2>Skills & Tools</h2>

* HTML
* CSS

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
Spending two weeks learning HTML & CSS and put in practice, setting up environment, learning Github and Git, to create my first personal website. So far ver.1 is finished. Potential ver.2 ideas: updating responsive page layouts, switch light/dark mode, maybe create contact form, etc.
