# Personal Portfolio

[Link Here](https://claireweiz.github.io)


<h2>Description</h2>
My personal website, developed by HTML and CSS, where I list out all my projects, and share about myself. The website has three parts: landing page, about me, and portfolio. Simple as it is, which displays who I am and what I do.

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
This project took me two weeks to pick up my knowledge of HTML & CSS, setting up environment, learning Github and Git, to create my first personal website. So far ver.1 is finished. For ver.2 I want to adjust codes neater (use more Javascript or node.js), make responsive page layouts better, switch light/dark mode, maybe create contact form, etc.
